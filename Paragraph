1-	Write a detailed analysis of the complexity of Bubble and Selection sort algorithms
in a text file and push it to your Github repository.  Only a text file will be accepted.
Your analysis should consider best and worst cases where appropriate.  You do not need to give a mathematical
argument for average case complexity.  You do not need to analyze the Quick and Merge Sort algorithms.


The complexity of Bubble sort is at best is O(N) and worst O(N^2). The complexity of Selection sort is best
O(N^2) and O(N^2). You can see this also in the run times of my program because the second time around, on a
sorted list, bubble sort's time is considerable lower on the second one. Whereas, the selection sort's time does
not improve and stays around the same run time because of the complexity for best and worst case.
